## Application Code
The `demo-java-app` directory contains the source code for the Demo Java Web Application. Dive into this directory to explore the implementations.

## Jenkins Pipeline Code
In the `ci/Jenkins` directory, you'll find Jenkins pipeline script. These scripts automate the CI process, ensuring smooth integration of your application.

## ArgoCD Configuration File
Explore the `cd/argocd/argocd-basic.yaml` file to find configuration details of ArgoCD.

## Helm charts
The `helm` directory holds helm charts for deploying applications on Kubernetes.

## Project Details
üõ†Ô∏è **Tools Explored:**
- Jenkins, Sonarqube, Terraform, Kubectl, and more for CI/CD setup
- Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana for Monitoring
- Filebeat, Elasticsearch and Kibana for Logging 
- ArgoCD for GitOps practices

üö¢ **High-Level Overview:**
- Jenkins deployment on Docker
- Minikube Cluster creation using Docker as driver
- Dockerhub repositories for image management
- Helm charts for efficient monitoring and logging setup
- GitOps with ArgoCD - the cherry on top!

üìà **The journey covered everything from setting up tools to deploying demo java app, ensuring data persistence, and implementing CI/CD pipelines.**
